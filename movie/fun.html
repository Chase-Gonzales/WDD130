      <h3>Captain America Movies</h3>
      <p>Did Chris Evans, who portrays Captain America, initially turn down the role of Steve Rogers multiple times? Not only that but the original design
        for Captain America's shield was originally intended to be more triangular. The original costume worn by Captain America in the comics was quite different too 
        than the one from the films. It was more patriotic but less practical, with a bright red, white, and blue suit, and a winged mask. The movie 
        version’s design is much more tactical and battle-ready, while still paying homage to the original comics. For a last quick fun fact, did you know the Captain America shield 
        is actually very heavy? Chris Evans admitted that carrying it for long periods of time was rather quite physically challenging.

    <section class="card thor">
      <h3>Thor Movies</h3>
      <p>Thor made his debut in "Journey into Mystery" #83 (1962), created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby. Thor’s iconic hammer, Mjölnir, has a key feature: it can only 
          be lifted by those deemed "worthy." In the comics characters like Captain America, Beta Ray Bill, and even Hulk lift
          the hammer. An interesting fact about the actor is that Chris Hemsworth originally auditioned for the role of Thor using the line "I am Thor, son of Odin". 
          He even mentioned in a Wired interview that he had an early audition that didn't go well. His younger brother, Liam Hemsworth, also auditioned and almost got the part, but the producers ultimately felt 
          he was too young.

      <h3>Iron Man Movies</h3>
      <p>Iron Man first appeared in "Tales of Suspense" #39 (1963), created by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, Don Heck, and Jack Kirby. The story introduced Tony Stark as a wealthy 
        industrialist who builds a suit of armor to escape captivity in Vietnam (although later retconned to the modern-day conflicts). An interesting fact about his armor is that
        the Iron Man suits have undergone many upgrades and redesigns over the years. In the early comics, his suit was bulky and gray, but it was eventually redesigned into the iconic 
        gold and red suit we know today. Another big difference from the films and comics is the moment in "Iron Man" (2008) where Tony Stark reveals his identity to the world. This was 
        a bold departure from the comics, where Tony Stark’s identity remained secret for many years.

      <h3>Ant Man Movies</h3>
      <p>In the comics, the original Ant-Man was Hank Pym, a scientist who discovered a chemical called "Pym Particles," which allow him to change his size. Hank Pym first appeared in 
        Tales to Astonish #27 in 1962. He also had a brilliant mind and was a founding member of the Avengers. Another cool things about he comics is Ant-Man (Hank Pym) plays an important 
        role in the Civil War storyline. He sides with Iron Man, supporting the registration of superheroes. This was a pivotal moment in the comics, and though the movie adapted a similar 
        storyline, it focused more on Scott Lang's involvement and that he sided with captain america instead.

        The film adaptation changed his origin, linking him more to Tony Stark’s attempt to create peace.

      <h3>Hulk Movies</h3>
      <p>The Hulk first appeared in The Incredible Hulk #1 (1962), created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby and in the comics, Hulk’s strength is often portrayed as limitless. As for the MCU version of hulk in the 2008 film, Edward 
        Norton played Bruce Banner (Hulk). However, for later appearances in the MCU, the role was recast with Mark Ruffalo. At the time of the 2008 film the CGI used to create the Hulk in this movie was groundbreaking. 
        The character’s size, strength, and movement were carefully designed to look as realistic as possible.
